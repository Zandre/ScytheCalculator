# ScytheCalculator

## Overview

I recently (Feb 2022) completed a few training courses on Pluralsight and covered some interesting topics in Angular development, namely the [NgRX](https://ngrx.io/) framework. I find the best way to incorporate new-found knowledge is to use it in a small side-project that is fun to do and makes it easier to remember the new concepts. So, I built my own Scythe Calculator. Scythe is a strategic boardgame that I was introduced to a few years back, and I’ve taken quite a liking to it. The boardgame itself is complex, and the end-game calculations can be a nightmare. So why not automate them?
